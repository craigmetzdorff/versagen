# Versagen

Versatile Generator

Or

Universe Generator

A text-based game engine that allows the creation of DnD-style worlds with their own rules and structures.

This portion of the code is a library and cannot be executed. However, the text parser, command structure, and DI structures are all in place such that locations, entities, and other such structures can be added into the "world" and text commands can be processed.

This was originally a senior group project, but most of the code in this repo is my code and I can provide the original (private) repository as proof upon request.
